## React Gallery App
This project is about a single page app that uses API to fetch data specific to the user’s requirement. The project shows list of cat’s images when the page first loads. There are 3 buttons and when the user clicks a button the specific data is fetched. User can also search by typing in the input search field. 

## Skills and techniques required to complete the project
In this project I used React which is a javaScript library. I used JSX to build the gallery components in modular fashion. React router was used to build 3 routes and a search page. To fetch data, I used Fetch API.

## Getting Started
* Download the project into your computer.
* Click on extract all to unzip the folder and set its destination.
* In command prompt move up to the file and run npm start. (Install Node.js first)
* Then open google chrome and view the app at http://localhost:3000.
* To use this app, you need to get flickr api.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
